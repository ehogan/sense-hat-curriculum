title: Making Sense of the Weather â€” Volunteer Notes
---

# Introduction

In this project, children will learn how to compare the data from the
temperature and humidity sensors on the Sense HAT with temperature and humidity
data from Met Office DataPoint (http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/datapoint).

# Online Resources

__This project uses Python 3.__ 

# Offline Resources

This project can also be completed offline on a Raspberry Pi computer with a
Sense HAT (see
https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/physical-sense-hat/).

# Learning Objectives

+ Physical computing - sensors;
+ RGB Colours;
+ Sense HAT display;

This project covers elements from the following strands of the Raspberry Pi
Digital Making Curriculum(http://rpf.io/curriculum): 

+ Combine programming constructs to solve a problem
  (https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)
